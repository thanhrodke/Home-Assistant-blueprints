Home Assistant Blueprints
A collection of reusable Home Assistant blueprints for automations, designed for efficiency and persistence. This repository houses blueprints to streamline smart home setups, starting with a persistent timer blueprint that survives Home Assistant reboots.
Blueprints
Persistent Timer for Automation

File: persistent_timer.yaml
Description: Creates automations with delays that persist across Home Assistant reboots using an input_datetime helper. Ideal for scenarios like delayed notifications (e.g., dishwasher completion).
Usage:
Create an input_datetime helper (e.g., input_datetime.tag_dishwasher_timer) via Settings > Devices & Services > Helpers > Date and/or Time.
Import the blueprint in Home Assistant: Settings > Automations & Scenes > Blueprints > Import Blueprint, using the raw URL (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yourusername/home-assistant-blueprints/main/persistent_timer.yaml).
Configure the automation:
Automation Alias: Name of your automation (e.g., Tag - dishwasher).
Trigger: Your trigger (e.g., tag scan, state change).
Delay Duration: Time to wait (e.g., 02:30:00 for 2h30m).
Actions: Actions to execute post-delay (e.g., send notification).


Add the startup_timer_check.yaml automation to catch missed timers on reboot.


Example: Triggers on a tag scan, waits 2h30m, then notifies a mobile device.

Startup Timer Check

File: startup_timer_check.yaml
Description: Automation that checks all persistent timers on Home Assistant startup, triggering any that expired during downtime.
Usage:
Add to Home Assistant via Settings > Automations & Scenes > Create Automation > Edit in YAML, or append to automations.yaml.
Ensure it runs automatically on startup to support all blueprint-based timers.
